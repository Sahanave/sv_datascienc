        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>Hello! I am Sahana Venkatesh, a passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer committed to leveraging technology for meaningful impact. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and fostering innovation through cutting-edge data science and machine learning techniques.</p>
        <p>With a solid background in machine learning, computer vision, and data science, I specialize in developing and deploying machine learning models and data products. My work spans various domains and I am constantly exploring new horizons in technology to make a difference.</p>

        <h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning: Model development, training, and deployment</li>
            <li>Data Science: Data analysis, visualization, and feature engineering</li>
            <li>Computer Vision: Image processing, hyperspectral imaging, and deep learning</li>
            <li>Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon SageMaker, Azure</li>
            <li>Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL</li>
            <li>Tools & Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, AWS</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sahanave/WomenWhoCodeHSIDemo" target="_blank">Project 1: HyperSpectral Data Analysis</a></h3>
        <p>Explore the unseen spectrum of data! In this project, I delve into hyperspectral image analysis, showcasing techniques for data ingestion and visualization. This project aims to simplify object detection tasks by leveraging hyperspectral imaging. It's a fantastic resource for beginners looking to get started with HSI images.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/dimfoo/hackathon" target="_blank">Project 2: Mission Predictable Hackathon</a></h3>
        <p>As part of an AWS-sponsored hackathon by Women Who Code, our team developed a predictive model to identify at-risk individuals likely to test positive for COVID-19. By focusing on the Mexico COVID-19 dataset, we aimed to optimize testing resources and health education efforts, ensuring they reach those who need them most.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sahanave/wwcode_hackathon2023_anxiety_management_tool" target="_blank">Project 3: AnxiAid: AI-Powered Anxiety Management Platform</a></h3>
        <p>I aim to address the lack of continuous monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies for patients with anxiety by creating an AI-Powered Anxiety Management Platform. This platform will engage patients more profoundly in their healing journey while allowing therapists to track progress outside regular sessions. My solution holds the potential to revolutionize anxiety treatment, fostering a proactive approach and creating a meaningful impact on society by enhancing mental health outcomes. I have chosen GitLab for version control, Streamlit for its rapid application deployment capabilities, and the OpenAI API for leveraging cutting-edge Generative AI models to achieve these goals. This was my submission for Women Who Code Hackathon for Social Good 2023.</p>
