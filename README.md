# Sahana's Data Science Portfolio Website

## Introduction 

I am Sahana. I am from India. I graduated with my bachelors in Electrical and Communication Engineering with minor in Mathematics. I hold Masters in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Apeel.


Previously I worked at Impact Vision developing optimized machine learning algorithms and working on software development. I also worked briefly at the At Passur Aerospace while pursuing my master's as a Software engineering intern focusing on UI projects and estimation algorithms. After graduation, I was grateful to work as a deep learning intern at Foodcache, working on image processing and deep learning algorithms.
My research interests include image processing and deep learning on challenging datasets.

I tend to update the portfolio with personal projects or challenges I am working on in my free time. 

## [Project 1 HyperSpectral Data Analysis](https://github.com/Sahanave/WomenWhoCodeHSIDemo)

We are so used to seeing our world in 3 colors. What if I tell you there are other spectrums you can tap into for your analysis? 
    
That can simplify object detection tasks in some cases. I hope to use this repo to assist beginners in getting started with processing HSI images focusing on data ingestion and data visualization. 

This is part of my talk on Hyperspectral image analysis during the WomenWhoCode Open-house


## [Project 2 Mission Predictable Hackathon](https://github.com/dimfoo/hackathon)

We were working this as part of a hackthon sponcerd by AWS. We need a model that will tell us which at-risk individuals are likely to test positive for COVID-19 so that health workers can target testing resources and health education toward that population. For our initial study, we use the Mexico CoVID-19 dataset.
